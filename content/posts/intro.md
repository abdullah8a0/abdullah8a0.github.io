Hi! I am a computer science and mathematics graduate from MIT. I currently work as an R&D engineer at Siemens EDA, focusing on solvers and performance in design verification. I enjoy picking up new skills (both technical and non-technical, like cooking and lockpicking) and pushing the frontiers of my knowledge.

I am particularly interested in **hardware/software co-design**, **computer architecture**, **formal methods**, and **security**.

I have relevant work and research experience in the fields of performance engineering and formal verification and have contributed to several projects in the past. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or discuss anything further.
